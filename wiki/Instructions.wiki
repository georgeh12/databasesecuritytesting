#summary How 2 Install Eclipse

= Introduction =

It was a real pain trying to install all the plug-ins for Eclipse, so this should simplify the process. Please add to this page if you install other plug-ins for your code.


= Instructions =

1. Download and install Eclipse PHP:

http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/galileo/SR1/eclipse-php-galileo-SR1-win32.zip

I recommend downloading using BitTorrent. After downloading, unzip and place the eclipse folder wherever you choose.

2. Install the javaw path (using cmd.exe in Windows OS). You must be in the eclipse directory before running the command. In dos this means typing:

cd %eclipse_path%

%eclipse_path% is the absolute path to the eclipse directory. Once you are in the directory, enter the following instruction:

eclipse -vm %javapath%\javaw.exe

%javapath% could be something like "c:\jdk1.4.2\jre\bin". I am running Windows Vista and it was installed to "C:\Windows\System32". Just do a search if you can't find it.

Now Eclipse should open. Set up your workspace directory.

3. Download and install the ActivePerl for your OS:
http://ppm4.activestate.com/

It does not matter where you install ActivePerl, but you need the location of the executable later.

4. Install the EPIC plug-in for Eclipse.
     1. In Eclipse, open the "Help" menu and click "Install New Software...".

     2. Click "Add" at the top right of the window.

     3. Give the plug-in a name and enter "http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/updates/testing" as the location.

     4. Select the check box next to "EPIC Main Components".

     5. Install the plug-in. Restart Eclipse when you are prompted to do so.


5. Install Perl into EPIC. In Eclipse, open the "Window" menu and click "Preferences". From the left menu, select "Perl EPIC". In the box labeled "Perl executable:" enter the location of the Perl executable from Step 3. For my installation it was "C:\Perl64\bin\perl5.10.0.exe". Click OK to save these settings.
