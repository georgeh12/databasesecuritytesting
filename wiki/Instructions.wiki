= Introduction =

It was a real pain trying to install all the plug-ins for Eclipse, so this should simplify the process. Please add to this page if you install other plug-ins for your code.


= Instructions =

 # Download and install [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/galileo/SR1/eclipse-php-galileo-SR1-win32.zip Eclipse PHP]
  * I recommend downloading using BitTorrent. After downloading, unzip and place the eclipse folder wherever you choose.
 # Install the javaw path (using cmd.exe in Windows OS). You must be in the eclipse directory before running the command. In dos this means typing:
  cd %eclipse_path%
  * %eclipse_path% is the absolute path to the eclipse directory. Once you are in the directory, enter the following instruction:
  eclipse -vm %javapath%\javaw.exe
  * %javapath% could be something like "c:\jdk1.4.2\jre\bin". I am running Windows Vista and it was installed to "C:\Windows\System32". Just do a search if you can't find it.
  * Now Eclipse should open. Set up your workspace directory.
 # Download and install the [http://ppm4.activestate.com/ ActivePerl] for your OS:
  * It does not matter where you install ActivePerl, but you need the location of the executable later.
 # Install the EPIC plug-in for Eclipse.
  * In Eclipse, open the "Help" menu and click "Install New Software...".
  * Click "Add" at the top right of the window.
  * Give the plug-in a name and enter "http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/updates/testing" as the location.
  * Select the check box next to "EPIC Main Components".
  * Install the plug-in. Restart Eclipse when you are prompted to do so.
 # Install Perl into EPIC.
  * In Eclipse, open the "Window" menu and click "Preferences".
  * From the left menu, select "Perl EPIC".
  * In the box labeled "Perl executable:" enter the location of the Perl executable from Step 3.
  * For my installation it was "C:\Perl64\bin\perl5.10.0.exe".
  * Click OK to save these settings.
